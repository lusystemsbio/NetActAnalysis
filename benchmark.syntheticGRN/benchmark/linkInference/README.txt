Two folders has the code for link inference performance for WT and KD data
    WT data: regNet.wt - Fig. 4bcd
    knockdown data: regNet.comb.kd9 - Fig. S7bcd

Each of the above two folders has the following subfolders:
    netactVSselMethods: calculates PRCs for selected methods 
    netactWithRegdbs: calcualtes PRCs for NetAct using perturbed regulons
    netactNewLinks: calculates PRCs for new interactions
