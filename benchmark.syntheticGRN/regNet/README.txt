The regulatory network generated using the folloiwng function and later simulated using RACIPE
createRegNetwork.R
    -network that has been used for benchmark was generated without seed
    -this function is created by updating the random.network.R function: 
          /Users/a.katebi/research/netact/sim.nca/tfnetwork.random/net30tf/src.net30tf/random.network.R
    -the library function it uses is copied from:
