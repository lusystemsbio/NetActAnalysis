Links inferred and precision-recall calculated in two ways: 
 (1) Folder: linksFromExp/
     links infferred from racipe simulated expressions 

 (2) Folder: linksFromNetAct/
     links inffered from NetAct activities calculated from racipe simulated expressions.  
     NetAct activities were calculated from racipe simulated expressions where regulon DBs 
     at different perturbation levelsi 0% (0), 25% (5), 50% (10), and 75% (15) were used: 
     regdb00/, regdb05/, regdb10/, regdb15/
